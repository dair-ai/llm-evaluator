## Example for Logging LLM Evaluator Prompt Responses

This notebook demonstrates a simple example of how to log prompt responses for an LLM-powered evaluator using Comet prompting tools.

This demo is for educational purposes. 

You can reproduce the demo by [creating a free account on Comet](https://www.comet.com/signup) and installing the necessary Python libraries needed for running the attached notebook. 

I have also provided the datasets used in the demonstration (see /data folder).

A few libraries we are using for this project:

- [comet-llm](https://github.com/comet-ml/comet-llm)
- [open-ai](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)
- [langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)

Open an issue if you need help or further instructions on how to run the notebook.
